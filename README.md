# odin-node-setup
my odin protocol validator quick setup with cosmovisor and statesync

here's how to use it.  Right now the script assumes you have a working ubuntu server 20.04 install, and have a non-root user with sudo access with username "cosmovisor"

```
wget https://github.com/iprouteth0/odin-node-setup/blob/main/odin-node-setup.sh
chmod +x odin-node-setup.sh
./odin-node-setup.sh
```
